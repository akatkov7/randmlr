randmlr
=======

An Android app that lets you select a tumblr and cycle through random pictures of that tumblr. The random feature on tumblr (i.e. http://TUMBLR_NAME.tumblr.com/random) does not distinguish between posts and images. This app will generate only random images by checking whether each random is a image and trying until it hits one that is an image.
